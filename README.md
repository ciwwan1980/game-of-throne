# Project Name

Game of Throne

## Requirements
 The SPA display all houses of Game of Thrones.

By clicking on one house there should be further information on a details page.

## Reflection

 1 - I used react hooks to build this SPA.
 2 - Custom hook "useFetch" for fetching API. Building custom Hooks for future improvement. I would add Navbar and desplay also Characters and fotos of actress and actors and their role in the movie. 
 3 - For the Icons i used Flaticon https://www.flaticon.com/de/.
 4- The website is fully responsive.
  
## Installation
