# Project Name

Game of Thrones

## Requirements

Create create a single page application. The SPA should display all houses of Game of Thrones.
If you click on one of the houses, you should be taken to a details page with more information.

## Reflection
- To create a single-page application, I use React.
- For fetching API, I created a custom hook called "useFetch".
- To import pictures, I used https://www.flaticon.com/de/ (dragon icon).
- In the readme.md file, I utilized the MarkDown template to offer an overview of the project and how to run it on your own computer.

## Future Improvment
- For future App improvement, I will add Navbar to fetch Characters and book API.
In the Detailed Page, I will add Previous and Next buttons. 
- I will use webpack 5 to run devServer with the same react Apllication.

### Deployment
- I deploy the App on vercel
- The link to the project is here:
 https://game-of-thrones-liard.vercel.app/


## Installation
 - Clone the repository
 - `npm install`
 - To run the application `npm start`
